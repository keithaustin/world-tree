# WorldTree - An ECS framework for Nim

A framework for the Entity-Component-System architecture, written in Nim. This project is in active development so it's not really useful yet, but please feel free to reach out with issues and suggestions! I will try to fill out this readme more completely as I get more done on the project. 

## What works so far?

Currently, you can instantiate a registry, create and destroy entities, and attach or detach components. You can also get and update the data from a component.

## What doesn't work so far?

Almost everything.
